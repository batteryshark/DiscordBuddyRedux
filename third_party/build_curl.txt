In order to built cURL with respect to /MT and /MTD you have to also execute Set RTLIBCFG=static before actually building it with the nmake command in the very same console. Full process of building cURL this way can be found here.

Edit: In case the URL stops working, I will also put the instructions here:

Download and extract the CUrl source code to a temp directory. http://curl.haxx.se/download.html, in this tutorial we will be using curl-7.37.0
Open the “Visual Studio Command Prompt (2010)”
Browse to the Winbuilds folder. \curl-7.37.0\winbuild.
Type Set RTLIBCFG=static into the command prompt and hit enter. This will set up the compiler to build for /MT and /MTd.
Type nmake /f MakeFile.vc mode=static DEBUG=yes to build the debug version or
Type nmake /f MakeFile.vc mode=static DEBUG=no to build the release versions.
